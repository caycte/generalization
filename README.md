# GENERALIZATION BOUNDS FOR DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
This repository contains the code to train convolutional and fully connected networks and compute various measures and generalization bounds on convolutional and fully connected networks. The architecture, training procedure and some of the measures are chosen the same the following paper:

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/caycte/generalization.git
   ```
2. Run the notebook fashion-mnist.ipynb to get the results of the different experiments (the results will be stored in final_results.json)

3. Plot the results similarly to the paper by running the notebook vizualizations.ipynb
